# Asset Reference

Used to import assets that are not yet actually used in the map but might be used during gameplay.

::: tip

Controlling the use of assets often requires implementation through scripts, and the [`Executor`](../item/executor#Variables) interface has dedicated variables for saving asset references. Therefore, this component is ~~actually not very useful~~.
